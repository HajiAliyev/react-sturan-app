React  App
Welcome to the React  App repository!

Overview
In this project, we leverage Babel to seamlessly convert modern JavaScript code (written in ES6 and ES7) from src/app.js into ES5, ensuring compatibility across all browsers.

How It Works
Babel Transformation:

Our source code, located in src/app.js, is written in the latest JavaScript standards, including ES6 and ES7.
Babel, our trusty JavaScript compiler, translates this cutting-edge code into ES5, a version universally supported by all browsers.
HTML Integration:

In our index.html file, after including React library scripts, we reference our transformed JavaScript file.
Add the following line to your HTML file:
html
Copy code
<script type="application/javascript" src="scripts/app.js"></script>
Why Babel?
Considering the diverse landscape of browsers, not all of them fully support the latest JavaScript standards. Babel acts as our language translator, making sure our code speaks the language every browser understands.
