Babel converts ES6, ES& js codes (src/app.js) to ES5 (public/scripts/app.js)
Index.html - after react library scripts, type <script type="application/javascript" src="scripts/app.js"></script> (reference to public/scripts/app.js)

Because we have to consider all of browser cannot support javascript as these versions:ES6. ES7. There is Babel which helps us to convert our code to ES5 which all browsers can support and understand codes.
